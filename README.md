SCANNER
=======

This repo holds the software that runs on the custom tracking and permission
managment system that will be adopted by the BSA for large events.  Each user
is given a LoCo magnetic stripe card which holds their assigned id. Scans (punches in and out) are stored in a local MySQL database.
